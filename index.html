        <p>
          At the age of 13, <strong>Camila Hayes</strong> inherited her mother's photo camera, marking the beginning of
          her profound love for photography and a constant pursuit of expressing herself through visual language, which
          led to her fascination with cinema. Years later, she graduated from the National University of Córdoba with a
          bachelor's degree in film and television and further specialized with a Master's in Cinematography from the
          Escola Superior de Cinema i Audiovisuals de Catalunya. <br />
          Mountaineering and rock climbing took her on adventures to remote places, where she discovered a profound
          curiosity for rural inhabitants and how their lives intertwine with the landscape. From this intrinsic
          relationship between humans and nature arise her aesthetic inclinations and her way of conceiving existence.
          Just as different weather atmospheres shape our moods, she seeks to create cinematic atmospheres that
          emotionally resonate with the viewer, as she considers art to be primarily an affective experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Julia Groppo</strong> grew up immersed in the world of music from an early age. Singer, guitarist, and
          drummer, she has explored a wide range of genres that have shaped her unique personal style. Her great passion
          for storytelling and boundless sonic expression, found in film music the perfect canvas to experiment with
          sound. She graduated from the Universidad Católica Argentina with a degree in Composition and Production of
          Cinematic Music, where she expanded her knowledge in piano, classical music, production, and sound design. Her
          diverse trajectory is now reflected in a remarkable versatility to tackle artistic projects. She skillfully
          blends the organic and the digital, silence and sound, abundance and simplicity, giving life to soundscapes
          that awaken consciousness.
